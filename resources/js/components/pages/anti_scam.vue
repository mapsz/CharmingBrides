        'The activity of our agency is aimed at helping people from different parts of the world find each other and create happy unions. Our mission is to help everybody who needs our help, find their life partners and make up happy families. During more than 17 years of work we have matched many couples who live in love and harmony. And indeed we are very proud of it. It means that our work is important and it is needed. That is why we care a lot about anti-scam policy of Charming Brides. The trust of our customers is very importance for us.',
        'What is scam? Scamming and catfishing online is the money hunting. Eastern European countries definitely aren’t poor, but they are somewhat worse provided than western countries. Girls from the small towns and villages may adopt the vicious behavior. On another hand, spoiled daddy’s girls from big and prosperous cities especially capitals, may seek financial profit as well without having any serious intentions. Those are gold diggers.',
        'The types of scam and how to deal with it',
        'There are two types of fraud online, the first type is produced by the agency itself and the second type is produced by girls who date independently. It’s easy to recognize both types.',
        'We always avoid such platforms and personalities, and do not include them to our lists of recommendations. But our users should know how to stay away from them as well.',
        'So, fraudulent platforms are recognizable by similar scenarios that different girls repeat to men, for example, being victims of war or living in a remote village with a need of expensive taxi.',
        'While non-serious girls who date independently, may start their very first letter from complaints or money requests as well, but by using a unique scenario. That’s not good either.',
        'Many men who are thinking about trying to find a soul mate abroad are concerned about the risk of being hurt by somebody who is only interested in money and has no interest in starting relationship this way. Our agency has no tolerance towards any kinds of scammers.',
        'All the services on our site are absolutely free of charge for the ladies (including the service of the professional translators), the women don\'t have to pay for anything at all, it\'s been our policy since the day we started operating. Before their registration on Charming Brides all the ladies take many tests and check-ups, such as the following:',
        '1) All the information in profiles of the girls is thoroughly checked. Our Anti-scam department verifies all the data a lady has been provided us with. Usually we call a lady and ask her some questions from the profile. As far as we are concerned there are cases when our agent agency can fill in our form instead of a woman, or just creates false profiles of women. It is important for us to bar them from deceiving us and our male clients. That is why we are testing a girl from the first stage. We register only those ladies who manage to prove their sincere intentions to find a foreign life partner. ',
        '2) Either a girl comes to the office to be registered on the site, or she is interviewed online by a manager, she provides all the pages of her passport to prove that all the information in her profile is true. Also providing the information regarding the marriage status is a must. We do not register married girls.',
        '3) All the ladies have constant check-ups in Skype by our managers during all their being in our agency. If a girl was registered by our agents from other cities, our manages always ask her the questions regarding the correspondence she is having, to make sure it is she who is leading this correspondence. We control all our agents’d work and true intentions corresponding to our mission. ',
        'Our main anti-scam activity includes effective recommendations to our men clients how to avoid fraud and scam in their search of a life partner. ',
        '1) Do not send money the girl you have not met in real life. This is a recommendation number 1.',
        '2) Once you detect a suspicious female member on our website or a lady is asking directly or even hinting at financial help, report her immediately to the site administration. We do not allow such things to take place on Charming Brides.',
        '3) We advice our customers to apply their intellectual abilities and do not rely only on your logic or intuition, keep on analyzing and testing, genuine girls won’t be annoyed by that and false girls will be detected.',
        '4) To avoid a misunderstanding during the first meeting and to make sure you are corresponding with the very girl you see on the photos, we recommend to ask the girls send their amateur photos, selfies to see how they look in everyday life. There is a service on the site when a man can order an amateur photo album of a lady. It is very helpful at the beginning of the communication. Also we recommend to ask a girl’s permission to have a video chat (the translator is provided if necessary). If a girl is serious and really interested, she always agrees to that. If she makes the excuses all the time trying to avoid or postpone the video chat, it is a good food for thinking for a man. ',
        '5) Don\'t rush the relationship. Take your time and get to know a lady. If she were a scammer she would not waste her time on long drawn out targets. Scammers want to have a result just now. ',
        'We are providing our clients with an absolutely real chance to meet their soul mate. Using Charming Brides service is completely safe and secure. We wish everyone find their love and be happy. Every new couple proves that all that we do is not in vain!',
