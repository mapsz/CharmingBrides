      :p-body="['Ukraine is situated in the southeastern part of Central Europe and has its own territory, government, national emblem, flag and anthem. It borders on Russia, Byelorussia, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Poland on land and Russia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey across the sea. A lot of cites of the word are connected with Kharkov via air routes. The territory of Ukraine is mostly a level, treeless plain, called \'steppe\'. There are the Crimean Mountains in the Crimean peninsula and the Carpathians in the west, but they are not very high. Mixed forests of pine and fir-trees, beeches, lime trees, oaks and elms cover the mountains, but the thickest woods can still be found in the northern part of the country. The main Ukrainian river is the Dnepr. It is one of the longest European rivers and one of the country\'s main sources of hydroelectric power.']"
